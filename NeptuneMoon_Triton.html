        <strong>Neptune's Unique Moon</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Triton is the largest moon of Neptune and was the first to be discovered. It’s the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation, which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured.
        </p>

        <strong>Extremely Cold and Geological Activity</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
           Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s one of the few moons in the solar system known to be geologically active. 
        </p>

        <strong>Composition and Atmosphere</strong>
        <br>
        <p> Triton has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen, a mostly water-ice crust, an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal. Active geysers are discovered to erupt sublimated nitrogen gas to the air, giving Triton a thin nitrogen atmosphere less than 1⁄70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.
