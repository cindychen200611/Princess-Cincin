        <h2>Jupiter's Mysterious Ring System: </h2>
        <h3>A Cosmic Dance of Dust and Gravel</h3>

        <strong>Overview</strong>
        <br>  
        <p>
            Jupiter has a bleak planetary ring system, about 6,500 kilometers wide and less than 10 kilometers thick.
        </p>

        <strong>Composition and Characteristics</strong>
        <br>       
        <p>
            It consists of a large amount of dust and black gravel, rotating around Jupiter with a cycle of about 7 hours.
        </p>

        <strong>Three Main Components</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            The ring consists of three main parts: the inner side is like a recepta, a halo ring composed of particles, a relatively bright main ring in the middle, and a tulle ring in the outer ring. ( These rings seem to be composed of dust, unlike Saturn's rings are composed of ice.)
        </p>

        <strong>Origin of the Rings</strong>
        <br>
        <p>    
            The main ring may be composed of material erupted from the satellites Adrasthea and MÃ©tis. Normally, the material that should fall back to the satellite is attracted by Jupiter due to the influence of Jupiter's strong gravity. These materials change their orbit towards Jupiter, and new materials continue to be added due to the impact of collisions. In the same way, Tebe and Amarce may form two dusty parts of the tulle ring. There is also evidence that there may be a series of rock fragments formed by collisions with this satellite along Amarse's orbit.
