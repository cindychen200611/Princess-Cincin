        <strong>Overview</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            The largest Lunar maria are the dark topographical features that can be observed on the lunar surface, covering about 15% of the Moon's crust, and which have dazzled astronomers and moon-gazers for centuries. The maria, or ‘seas’, were named by early astronomers who mistook them for actual oceans on the Moon, but of course today we know that no such large bodies of liquid water exist on the lunar surface.

        <strong>Formation of Lunar Maria</strong>
        <br>
        <p>The lunar maria are impact basins created by collisions with cosmic debris that filled with lava and other lunar material between 1-4 billion years ago.
        </p>

        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
        <br>
        <p>Lunar maria has long been a source of mystery for planetary scientists. Maybe giving it a visit can inspire you to pursue your astronaut dream!</p>
