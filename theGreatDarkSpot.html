        <strong>The Great Dark Spot on Neptune</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Great Dark Spot (also known as GDS-89, for Great Dark Spot, 1989) was one of a series of dark spots on Neptune. In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe.

        <strong>Characteristics of Great Dark Spots</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms, with a high-pressure center. Their lifetimes appear to be relatively short, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. The knowledge about its origins, movement, and disappearance is little.

        <strong>Impressive Size and Shifting Nature</strong>
        <br>
        <p>The Great Dark Spot is as wide as Earth and has shown the ability to shift north-south over time.</p>
