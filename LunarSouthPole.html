        <strong>Exploring Permanently Shadowed Regions</strong>
        <br>
        <p>Here, there are craters known as permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). Sometimes dubbed "craters of eternal darkness", these are angled in such a way that the Sun's rays never reach their innards, meaning they have potentially stored ice for billions of years. The South Pole has more craters than the North Pole, likely a random outcome of how many meteorite impacts have hit the surface, making the South Pole an attractive destination. Maybe youâ€™ll see Chandrayaan-3 which is the first rover in history to land on the Lunar South Pole!
