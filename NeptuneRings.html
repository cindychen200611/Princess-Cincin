        <strong>Compositon of Neptune's Unique Ring System</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Neptune has primarily five principal rings. Much of its
ring system is faint and dusty, containing a high proportion of
dust, unlike Saturn’s relatively dense one. The rings are made
of extremely dark material, like organic compounds processed
by radiation.
        </p>

        <strong>The Five Named Rings</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
           The five rings are named after astronomers who
contributed important work on the planet: Galle, Le Verrier,
Lassell, Arago, and Adams (in order of increasing distance from
the planet). Some of its moons’ orbits are inside the ring
system. 
        </p>

        <strong>Youthful Rings</strong>
        <br>
        <p>The rings of Neptune are much younger than the solar
system. They were probably created when one of Neptune’s
inner moons got too close to the planet and was torn apart by
gravity.
