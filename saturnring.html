        <strong>Saturn's Famous Rings Through History</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Saturn Rings is one of the most well-known outer space attractions. In July 1610, Galileo observed the Saturn Rings through his homemade telescope, but due to the poor imaging quality, he didn't realize it was a ring. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens observed the complete Saturn Rings using a much more powerful telescope than what was available in Galileo's time.

        <strong>Exploring the Cassini Division</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            We will take you to Cassini Division. The Cassini Division exists between the A Ring and the B Ring, with a width of 4800 kilometers, making it the widest gap in Saturn's rings.

        <strong>Dione's Role and Spiral Waves</strong>
        <br>
        <p> Saturn's moon, Dione, plays a role in maintaining the Cassini Division, and other ring-like structures create spiral waves due to periodic disturbances from other satellites.</p>
