        <strong>Perseverance Rover's Geologic Discovery</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Perseverance rover has captured new images that appear to reveal geologic evidence of a fast-flowing river that fed into Jezero Crater. Perseverance began exploring the remnants of the environment within the crater after landing on the red planet in February 2021. The rover discovered a fan-shaped deposit in the area that stands 820 feet (250 meters) tall, likely the remnants of an ancient river delta, in the crater.

        <strong>Diverse Water-Associated Environments</strong>
        <br>
        <p> With the rover Perseverance, we’re actually moving through different environments that once had water associated with them. So here in Jezero, we have evidence of lakes, deltas and ancient rivers.

        <strong>Mysterious Site Exploration</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            You can take a look at the mysterious site where water might have flowed billions of years ago, and maybe you’ll bump into Perseverance!
