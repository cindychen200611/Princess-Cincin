        <strong>Unexpected Attraction - A Mars Exploration Starting Point</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Seeing this attraction, you might find it strange because it's not even on Mars. However, starting your Mars exploration journey with Devon Island is just perfect. It can help spark your interest and anticipation for the upcoming adventures!

        <strong>Mars-Like Terrain on Earth</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the northern reaches of Canada, there is a remote island with terrain so rugged that it helps scientists prepare for missions to Mars. Located in close proximity to Greenland, uninhabited Devon Island is believed to be the closest landscape on Earth to the Red Planet.
        </p>

        <strong>Harsh Conditions</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Devon Island is freezing cold, dusty, and almost entirely devoid of plant life. Images of Devon Island are nearly identical to those beamed back to Earth by the Perseverance rover.
        </p>

        <strong>Similar Features to Mars</strong>
        <br>
        <p>  Much like Mars, Devon Island features a sizable crater and “patterned ground” covered in ice that routinely thaws and refreezes. Devon Island is even home to a V-shaped canyon that is almost identical to those spotted on Mars. Devon Island’s V-shaped canyon is appropriately called Astronaut Canyon.
